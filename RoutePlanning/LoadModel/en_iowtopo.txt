A high resolution spherical grid topography of the Baltic Sea

The data sets presented here provide a digitised topography of the Baltic
Sea. Land heights and water depths have been calculated for two regular
spherical grids from available data. Data set "iowtopo2" covers the whole
Baltic Sea from 9° to 31° East and from 53°30’ to 66° North by (660 x 750)
grid cells, see Fig. 1. The resolution is 2 minutes with respect to
longitude, and 1 minute to latitude. This is approximately 1 nautical mile,
or 2 km resp. The region of the Belt Sea from 9° to 15°10’ East and from
53°30’ to 56°30’ North, see Fig 2, is comprised within data set "iowtopo1"
with a twofold higher resolution (1 minute in longitude and 0.5 minutes in
latitude corresponding to approx. 1 km). The data sets were published at
the Baltic Sea Science Congress in Stockholm on 27. November 2001. A short
description of the data compilation is available online:
http://www.io-warnemuende.de/research/iowtopo_resampling.html

The data specify a representative average of the water depth or the land
height of each grid cell, counted by negative and positive values in
meters. Some statistical parameters allow a rough estimate of the
reliability of the data. (Please be aware that data are rather uncertain in
regions where strong gradients of the bottom relief occur, esp. the
northern parts of the Baltic. There is an urgent need of further bathymetry
data to become available for the Baltic beyond 59° North.) Since a common
average of land heights and water depths lead to rather unsatisfying
results with respect to the gridded shoreline, a landmask is proposed in
both data sets. The landmasks were derived from the global high resolution
shorelines GSHHS (www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhs/gshhs.html) and RANGS
(www.io-warnemuende.de/homepages/rfeistel/index.html), and used to get a
"naturally looking" composite topography (z_topo see below).

Data are provided in two formats. NetCDF files (*.nc) are self-desribing
binaries which may be visualised and processed by tools like for instance:

     Ferret ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/Ferret/
     Grads grads.iges.org/grads/
     Matlab www.mathworks.de

Alternatively rather big ascii files (*.dat) are given which start with two
header lines and contain the following data:
 xlon    – the geographic longitude of the grid cell centre
 ylat    – the corresponding geographical latitude

 z_topo  – land height/water depth, composite of z_water, z_land and the
         proposed landmask

 z_water – average of all water depths allocated from original data to
         this grid cell

 z_land  – average of land heights allocated to this grid cell from
         edcdaac.usgs.gov/gtopo30/gtopo30.html data

 z_min   – minimal value of the original data
 z_max   – maximal value of the original data

 z_stdev – standard deviation of original data from averages z_water/z_land

 z_near  – datum lying nearest to the centre of this grid cell
 d-near  – distance of above mentioned data point from centre of grid cell

 n_wet   > 0 number of original water depths allocated to this grid cell
         < 0 number of neighbours interpolated to fill this empty cell

 n_dry   > 0 number of original land heights allocated to this cell
         < 0 number of iterations to find neighbours for interpolation
 landmask– proposed "naturally loking" landmask (land=0, water=1)

 flag    –flag indicating a pure data average (0), or an
         interpolated/masked land height (+1) or water depth (-1)

Blanked out segment of disturbed data off Norway ("land" +0.1m in iowtopo2). 
IOW bathymetry of 1995 included to fill all water cells by data.
All output data in netCDF and ascii files rounded equally to 0.1 m. 

last update: 30.05.2007  

In file iowtopo2_rev03 the depths z_topo and z_water have been changed in the
area of the eastern Gotland Sea (18°30'-21°30'E, 56°30'-58°N) to avoid an
artifitial steep bottom gradient at the north-eastern rim of the basin (only
data from the GEOBALT chart, Gelumbauskaite et al. (1999), and from the
MESODYN measurements, Reissmann (1999), are included in this area now).
From now on the release is indicated in the file names (rev03 for current,
rev02 for last version).

last update: 16.01.2008

By an error in the output filter wrongly formatted ascii data were provided for iowtopo2_rev03.dat. 
This has been corrected by setting undefined z_water and z_land to zero.
Note that the landmask is land=1 and water=0 since rev03.
